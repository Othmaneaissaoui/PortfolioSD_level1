                        <p>Fortran is the oldest programming language still in use, primarily for 
                            scientific calculations. It initially lacked features like pointers, making 
                            it challenging for system tasks. Fortran 77 improved control structures and
                             character data. Fortran 90 introduced pointers for increased reliability,
                             while Fortran 95 allows custom data types, similar to C programming.</p>

                        <small>1959</small>
                        <p>It was created because it's easier to write and read. The use of COBOL
                             has declined, but the Dutch government still used it in 2018. In the past,
                              COBOL was common on Digital computers like VAX and Alpha. The group behind 
                              COBOL introduced COBOL-61, and its usage increased. COBOL-74 is an improved 
                              version with collaboration with ANSI. In COBOL-2002, it's possible to use a
                              multi-paradigm programming language. Grace Murray Hopper played a significant
                               role in COBOL's development.</p>

                        <p>In 1972, the programming language C was introduced, and it is 
                            still widely used today. It quickly gained popularity worldwide.
                             The designer, Dennis Ritchie, also found success with Unix. Many
                              programming languages, such as C# and C++, have their origins in C.
                               C remains a favorite among programmers and is one of the most prominent
                                programming languages globally. It's suitable for creating games and apps.
                             Dennis Ritchie played a pivotal role in its development.</p>

                        <small> 1991</small>
                        <p>Python is a widely-used programming language, especially for data and 
                            game development. It is primarily used for backend programming. Python 
                            uses duck-typing, allowing you to adapt objects with new methods. Python
                             code is written in text files with specific extensions. To execute Python,
                              you use the "python" command at the beginning of your code. It is known for 
                              its readable syntax, making it pleasant to read and write code. Python is also 
                              commonly used for automating tasks.
                             Guido van Rossum played a significant role in its development.</p>

                        <p>PHP, originally known as Personal Home Page Tools, is now called Hypertext
                             Preprocessor or simply PHP. It is a backend programming language primarily
                              used for websites. PHP is used worldwide and is particularly useful for 
                              presenting and storing data, enabling functions like creating a guestbook 
                              for people to leave and view messages. PHP also allows for embedding HTML
                               code on various pages.
                             Rasmus Lerdorf played a key role in its creation.</p>

                        <p>Java allows you to create software for various platforms,
                             using the "Write once run anywhere" (WORA) approach.
                              It's used for developing services and applications. 
                              The advantage of Java is its platform independence, 
                              as it runs on any operating system. However, it may not be the fastest language. 
                              Sun Microsystems originally owned Java,
                             and it is now owned by Oracle Corporation.</p>

                            programming languages. It can be used for various purposes, including creating
                             web pages, web forms, web applications, and browser games.
                             Brandon Eich was a key figure in the creation of JavaScript.</p>

                        <p>HTML and CSS are languages used for creating websites. HTML is 
                            used for structuring web content, 
                            while CSS is used for designing the appearance of web pages.
                             HTML5 is the most recent version of HTML, and CSS3 is the latest
                              version of CSS. Tim Berners-Lee played a significant role in the development 
                              of HTML and is often credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web.</p>

                            considered more capable and powerful.
                             Anders Hejlsberg played a significant role in the development of C#.</p>
