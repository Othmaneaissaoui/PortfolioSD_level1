                        <p>The Altair 8800 is a microcomputer designed in 1974 by MITS and based on the
                            Intel 8080 CPU. Interest grew quickly after it was featured on the cover of the January
                            1975 issue of Popular Electronics. According to Harry
                            Garland, the Altair 8800 was the product that catalyzed the microcomputer revolution of the
                            1970s.</p>

                        <p>On March 5 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the Homebrew
                            Computer Club in Gordon French's garage. Steve immediately went to work and after building a computer and
                            showing it at the club, he and Steve Jobs gave out technical designs for the
                            computer to interested club members and helped some of them build and test out
                            copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single
                            circuit board, just the bare board, with no electronic parts that
                            people could use to build the computers.</p>

                        <p>The Apple 2 was designed by Steve Wozniak, Jerry Manock developed the design
                            of Apple 2's case and Rod Holt developed the switching power supply. Steve Jobs's role in the
                            design of the computer was limited to overseeing Jerry Manock's work on the plastic case. It
                            was introduced by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak at
                            the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, and marks Apple's first launch of a personal computer.

                            Vic Hayes approached the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) to
                            create a standard and were involved in designing the initial 802.11b and 802.11a
                            specifications within the IEEE. They have both been subsequently inducted into the Wi-Fi.</p>

                            January 9, 2007, and was released in the United States on June 29, 2007. In 1999, Apple CEO
                            Steve Jobs envisioned an Apple touchscreen product that the user could interact with
                            directly with their fingers rather than using a stylus.</p>

                            programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left
                            before Google was officially founded as a company.</p>
